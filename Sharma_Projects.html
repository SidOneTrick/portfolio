My partner and I decided to make a game that worked a lot like a basic fighting game. It required two players and had many features that we made within a weeks time in class. We added features like punches, kicks, jumps, and special abilities. It was mainly meant to show how more complicated things can be made from simple ways.</p>

      <p style = "font-size: 18px; padding-top: 100px;" class = "col-sm-8 pull-right">In this project we were told to build upon a fairly easy to make app. App Inventor is a simple app building IDE used to teach basic programming skills. We made a Mash-A-Mole game which started out as a very elementary app. Later we created many other elements such as lives, holes, and many UI elements. </p>
