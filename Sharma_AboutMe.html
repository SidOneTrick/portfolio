I'm 15 years old and was born in the United States. I'm of Indian descent and both my parents try to influence me with religion. My hobbies include tennis, video games, computer programming, and martial arts. I work hard in school and always try to achieve good grades. I like to solve problems with reason and calculation and I am always trying to stay fit and eat healthy. My last semester grade was a 4.0 and that is always my goal every semester. I also like to expose myself to other cultures whether it's through videos online or visiting my friends homes. I travel yearly with my family to other countries around the world. I like to learn about how other people go about in their way of life. 
      <br> &nbsp Ever since I first learned about computers I've been fascinated in the way they work, what they do, and what I can do with them. Now, it they are simply part of my everyday life and it is kind of hard to think what life would be like without one. However, as I grew up I started becoming more keen in the use of the computer. This led to me thinking about what I wanted to do with my future. All I know for now is that it must have had to do with computer programming or just computers in general.
      <br> &nbsp While I am interested in multiple hobbies and activities I am also always trying to make time for my friends and family. When invited to a social event I try to always make time to go even if I had prior engagements. To me my friends are the most precious to me because they have shaped me into who I am and have had a huge impact on my perserverance and my future goals. I also respect my parents because while they may not understand everything I do they are trying to guide me in the right direction.</p>
